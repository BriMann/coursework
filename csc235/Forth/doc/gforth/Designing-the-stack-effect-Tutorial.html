<p>In other languages you can use an arbitrary order of parameters for a
function; and since there is only one result, you don&rsquo;t have to deal with
the order of results, either.
</p>
<p>In Forth (and other stack-based languages, e.g., PostScript) the
parameter and result order of a definition is important and should be
designed well.  The general guideline is to design the stack effect such
that the word is simple to use in most cases, even if that complicates
the implementation of the word.  Some concrete rules are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Words consume all of their parameters (e.g., <code>.</code>).

</li><li> If there is a convention on the order of parameters (e.g., from
mathematics or another programming language), stick with it (e.g.,
<code>-</code>).

</li><li> If one parameter usually requires only a short computation (e.g., it is
a constant), pass it on the top of the stack.  Conversely, parameters
that usually require a long sequence of code to compute should be passed
as the bottom (i.e., first) parameter.  This makes the code easier to
read, because the reader does not need to keep track of the bottom item
through a long sequence of code (or, alternatively, through stack
manipulations). E.g., <code>!</code> (store, see <a href="Memory.html">Memory</a>) expects the
address on top of the stack because it is usually simpler to compute
than the stored value (often the address is just a variable).

</li><li> Similarly, results that are usually consumed quickly should be returned
on the top of stack, whereas a result that is often used in long
computations should be passed as bottom result.  E.g., the file words
like <code>open-file</code> return the error code on the top of stack, because
it is usually consumed quickly by <code>throw</code>; moreover, the error code
has to be checked before doing anything with the other results.

</li></ul>

<p>These rules are just general guidelines, don&rsquo;t lose sight of the overall
goal to make the words easy to use.  E.g., if the convention rule
conflicts with the computation-length rule, you might decide in favour
of the convention if the word will be used rarely, and in favour of the
computation-length rule if the word will be used frequently (because
with frequent use the cost of breaking the computation-length rule would
be quite high, and frequent use makes it easier to remember an
unconventional order).
