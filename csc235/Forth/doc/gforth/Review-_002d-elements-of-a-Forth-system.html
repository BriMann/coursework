<!-- This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.3, June 14, 2014),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<p>To summarise this chapter:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Forth programs use <em>factoring</em> to break a problem down into small
fragments called <em>words</em> or <em>definitions</em>.
</li><li> Forth program development is an interactive process.
</li><li> The main command loop that accepts input, and controls both
interpretation and compilation, is called the <em>text interpreter</em>
(also known as the <em>outer interpreter</em>).
</li><li> Forth has a very simple syntax, consisting of words and numbers
separated by spaces or carriage-return characters. Any additional syntax
is imposed by <em>parsing words</em>.
</li><li> Forth uses a stack to pass parameters between words. As a result, it
uses postfix notation.
</li><li> To use a word that has previously been defined, the text interpreter
searches for the word in the <em>name dictionary</em>.
</li><li> Words have <em>interpretation semantics</em> and <em>compilation semantics</em>.
</li><li> The text interpreter uses the value of <code>state</code> to select between
the use of the <em>interpretation semantics</em> and the  <em>compilation
semantics</em> of a word that it encounters.
</li><li> The relationship between the <em>interpretation semantics</em> and
<em>compilation semantics</em> for a word
depend upon the way in which the word was defined (for example, whether
it is an <em>immediate</em> word).
</li><li> Forth definitions can be implemented in Forth (called <em>high-level
definitions</em>) or in some other way (usually a lower-level language and
as a result often called <em>low-level definitions</em>, <em>code
definitions</em> or <em>primitives</em>).
</li><li> Many Forth systems are implemented mainly in Forth.
</li></ul>
