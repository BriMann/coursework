<span id="index-text-interpreter-1"></span>
<span id="index-outer-interpreter-1"></span>

<p>In procedural programming languages (like C and Pascal), the
building-block of programs is the <em>function</em> or <em>procedure</em>. These
functions or procedures are called with <em>explicit parameters</em>. For
example, in C we might write:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">total = total + new_volume(length,height,depth);
</pre></div>

<p>where new_volume is a function-call to another piece of code, and total,
length, height and depth are all variables. length, height and depth are
parameters to the function-call.
</p>
<p>In Forth, the equivalent of the function or procedure is the
<em>definition</em> and parameters are implicitly passed between
definitions using a shared stack that is visible to the
programmer. Although Forth does support variables, the existence of the
stack means that they are used far less often than in most other
programming languages. When the text interpreter encounters a number, it
will place (<em>push</em>) it on the stack. There are several stacks (the
actual number is implementation-dependent ...) and the particular stack
used for any operation is implied unambiguously by the operation being
performed. The stack used for all integer operations is called the <em>data
stack</em> and, since this is the stack used most commonly, references to
&ldquo;the data stack&rdquo; are often abbreviated to &ldquo;the stack&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The stacks have a last-in, first-out (LIFO) organisation. If you type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>1 2 3<span class="key">RET</span></kbd>  ok
</pre></div>

<p>Then this instructs the text interpreter to placed three numbers on the
(data) stack. An analogy for the behaviour of the stack is to take a
pack of playing cards and deal out the ace (1), 2 and 3 into a pile on
the table. The 3 was the last card onto the pile (&ldquo;last-in&rdquo;) and if
you take a card off the pile then, unless you&rsquo;re prepared to fiddle a
bit, the card that you take off will be the 3 (&ldquo;first-out&rdquo;). The
number that will be first-out of the stack is called the <em>top of
stack</em>, which
<span id="index-TOS-definition"></span>
is often abbreviated to <em>TOS</em>.
</p>
<p>To understand how parameters are passed in Forth, consider the
behaviour of the definition <code>+</code> (pronounced &ldquo;plus&rdquo;). You will not
be surprised to learn that this definition performs addition. More
precisely, it adds two number together and produces a result. Where does
it get the two numbers from? It takes the top two numbers off the
stack. Where does it place the result? On the stack. You can act-out the
behaviour of <code>+</code> with your playing cards like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pick up two cards from the stack on the table
</li><li> Stare at them intently and ask yourself &ldquo;what <i>is</i> the sum of these two
numbers&rdquo;
</li><li> Decide that the answer is 5
</li><li> Shuffle the two cards back into the pack and find a 5
</li><li> Put a 5 on the remaining ace that&rsquo;s on the table.
</li></ul>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a pack of cards handy but you do have Forth running,
you can use the definition <code>.s</code> to show the current state of the stack,
without affecting the stack. Type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>clearstacks 1 2 3<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> ok
<kbd>.s<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> &lt;3&gt; 1 2 3  ok
</pre></div>

<p>The text interpreter looks up the word <code>clearstacks</code> and executes
it; it tidies up the stacks and removes any entries that may have been
left on it by earlier examples. The text interpreter pushes each of the
three numbers in turn onto the stack. Finally, the text interpreter
looks up the word <code>.s</code> and executes it. The effect of executing
<code>.s</code> is to print the &ldquo;&lt;3&gt;&rdquo; (the total number of items on the stack)
followed by a list of all the items on the stack; the item on the far
right-hand side is the TOS.
</p>
<p>You can now type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>+ .s<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> &lt;2&gt; 1 5  ok
</pre></div>

<p>which is correct; there are now 2 items on the stack and the result of
the addition is 5.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re playing with cards, try doing a second addition: pick up the
two cards, work out that their sum is 6, shuffle them into the pack,
look for a 6 and place that on the table. You now have just one item on
the stack. What happens if you try to do a third addition? Pick up the
first card, pick up the second card &ndash; ah! There is no second card. This
is called a <em>stack underflow</em> and consitutes an error. If you try to
do the same thing with Forth it often reports an error (probably a Stack
Underflow or an Invalid Memory Address error).
</p>
<p>The opposite situation to a stack underflow is a <em>stack overflow</em>,
which simply accepts that there is a finite amount of storage space
reserved for the stack. To stretch the playing card analogy, if you had
enough packs of cards and you piled the cards up on the table, you would
eventually be unable to add another card; you&rsquo;d hit the ceiling. Gforth
allows you to set the maximum size of the stacks. In general, the only
time that you will get a stack overflow is because a definition has a
bug in it and is generating data on the stack uncontrollably.
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one final use for the playing card analogy. If you model your
stack using a pack of playing cards, the maximum number of items on
your stack will be 52 (I assume you didn&rsquo;t use the Joker). The maximum
<i>value</i> of any item on the stack is 13 (the King). In fact, the only
possible numbers are positive integer numbers 1 through 13; you can&rsquo;t
have (for example) 0 or 27 or 3.52 or -2. If you change the way you
think about some of the cards, you can accommodate different
numbers. For example, you could think of the Jack as representing 0,
the Queen as representing -1 and the King as representing -2. Your
<i>range</i> remains unchanged (you can still only represent a total of 13
numbers) but the numbers that you can represent are -2 through 10.
</p>
<p>In that analogy, the limit was the amount of information that a single
stack entry could hold, and Forth has a similar limit. In Forth, the
size of a stack entry is called a <em>cell</em>. The actual size of a cell is
implementation dependent and affects the maximum value that a stack
entry can hold. A Standard Forth provides a cell size of at least
16-bits, and most desktop systems use a cell size of 32-bits.
</p>
<p>Forth does not do any type checking for you, so you are free to
manipulate and combine stack items in any way you wish. A convenient way
of treating stack items is as 2&rsquo;s complement signed integers, and that
is what Standard words like <code>+</code> do. Therefore you can type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>-5 12 + .s<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> &lt;1&gt; 7  ok
</pre></div>

<p>If you use numbers and definitions like <code>+</code> in order to turn Forth
into a great big pocket calculator, you will realise that it&rsquo;s rather
different from a normal calculator. Rather than typing 2 + 3 = you had
to type 2 3 + (ignore the fact that you had to use <code>.s</code> to see the
result). The terminology used to describe this difference is to say that
your calculator uses <em>Infix Notation</em> (parameters and operators are
mixed) whilst Forth uses <em>Postfix Notation</em> (parameters and
operators are separate), also called <em>Reverse Polish Notation</em>.
</p>
<p>Whilst postfix notation might look confusing to begin with, it has
several important advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> it is unambiguous
</li><li> it is more concise
</li><li> it fits naturally with a stack-based system
</li></ul>

<p>To examine these claims in more detail, consider these sums:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">6 + 5 * 4 =
4 * 5 + 6 =
</pre></div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just learning maths or your maths is very rusty, you will
probably come up with the answer 44 for the first and 26 for the
second. If you are a bit of a whizz at maths you will remember the
<i>convention</i> that multiplication takes precendence over addition, and
you&rsquo;d come up with the answer 26 both times. To explain the answer 26
to someone who got the answer 44, you&rsquo;d probably rewrite the first sum
like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">6 + (5 * 4) =
</pre></div>

<p>If what you really wanted was to perform the addition before the
multiplication, you would have to use parentheses to force it.
</p>
<p>If you did the first two sums on a pocket calculator you would probably
get the right answers, unless you were very cautious and entered them using
these keystroke sequences:
</p>
<p>6 + 5 = * 4 =
4 * 5 = + 6 =
</p>
<p>Postfix notation is unambiguous because the order that the operators
are applied is always explicit; that also means that parentheses are
never required. The operators are <i>active</i> (the act of quoting the
operator makes the operation occur) which removes the need for &ldquo;=&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The sum 6 + 5 * 4 can be written (in postfix notation) in two
equivalent ways:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">6 5 4 * +      or:
5 4 * 6 +
</pre></div>

<p>An important thing that you should notice about this notation is that
the <i>order</i> of the numbers does not change; if you want to subtract
2 from 10 you type <code>10 2 -</code>.
</p>
<p>The reason that Forth uses postfix notation is very simple to explain: it
makes the implementation extremely simple, and it follows naturally from
using the stack as a mechanism for passing parameters. Another way of
thinking about this is to realise that all Forth definitions are
<i>active</i>; they execute as they are encountered by the text
interpreter. The result of this is that the syntax of Forth is trivially
simple.
