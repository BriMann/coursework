<span id="index-first-definition"></span>

<p>Until now, the examples we&rsquo;ve seen have been trivial; we&rsquo;ve just been
using Forth as a bigger-than-pocket calculator. Also, each calculation
we&rsquo;ve shown has been a &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; &ndash; to repeat it we&rsquo;d need to type it in
again<a id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a> In this section we&rsquo;ll see how to add new
words to Forth&rsquo;s vocabulary.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to create a new word is to use a <em>colon
definition</em>. We&rsquo;ll define a few and try them out before worrying too
much about how they work. Try typing in these examples; be careful to
copy the spaces accurately:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">: add-two 2 + . ;
: greet .&quot; Hello and welcome&quot; ;
: demo 5 add-two ;
</pre></div>

<p>Now try them out:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>greet<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> Hello and welcome  ok
<kbd>greet greet<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> Hello and welcomeHello and welcome  ok
<kbd>4 add-two<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> 6  ok
<kbd>demo<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> 7  ok
<kbd>9 greet demo add-two<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> Hello and welcome7 11  ok
</pre></div>

<p>The first new thing that we&rsquo;ve introduced here is the pair of words
<code>:</code> and <code>;</code>. These are used to start and terminate a new
definition, respectively. The first word after the <code>:</code> is the name
for the new definition.
</p>
<p>As you can see from the examples, a definition is built up of words that
have already been defined; Forth makes no distinction between
definitions that existed when you started the system up, and those that
you define yourself.
</p>
<p>The examples also introduce the words <code>.</code> (dot), <code>.&quot;</code>
(dot-quote) and <code>dup</code> (dewp). Dot takes the value from the top of
the stack and displays it. It&rsquo;s like <code>.s</code> except that it only
displays the top item of the stack and it is destructive; after it has
executed, the number is no longer on the stack. There is always one
space printed after the number, and no spaces before it. Dot-quote
defines a string (a sequence of characters) that will be printed when
the word is executed. The string can contain any printable characters
except <code>&quot;</code>. A <code>&quot;</code> has a special function; it is not a Forth
word but it acts as a delimiter (the way that delimiters work is
described in the next section). Finally, <code>dup</code> duplicates the value
at the top of the stack. Try typing <code>5 dup .s</code> to see what it does.
</p>
<p>We already know that the text interpreter searches through the
dictionary to locate names. If you&rsquo;ve followed the examples earlier, you
will already have a definition called <code>add-two</code>. Lets try modifying
it by typing in a new definition:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>: add-two dup . .&quot; + 2 =&quot; 2 + . ;<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> redefined add-two  ok
</pre></div>

<p>Forth recognised that we were defining a word that already exists, and
printed a message to warn us of that fact. Let&rsquo;s try out the new
definition:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>9 add-two<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> 9 + 2 =11  ok
</pre></div>

<p>All that we&rsquo;ve actually done here, though, is to create a new
definition, with a particular name. The fact that there was already a
definition with the same name did not make any difference to the way
that the new definition was created (except that Forth printed a warning
message). The old definition of add-two still exists (try <code>demo</code>
again to see that this is true). Any new definition will use the new
definition of <code>add-two</code>, but old definitions continue to use the
version that already existed at the time that they were <code>compiled</code>.
</p>
<p>Before you go on to the next section, try defining and redefining some
words of your own.
</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h5><a id="FOOT7" href="#DOCF7">(7)</a></h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite true. If you press the up-arrow key on
your keyboard you should be able to scroll back to any earlier command,
edit it and re-enter it.</p>
